 * 
 * Declares the MIME type and the document's character encoding. The content attribute must have the value "text/html; charset=utf-8" if specified. This is equivalent to a <meta> element with the charset attribute specified and carries the same restriction on placement within the document. Note: Can only be used in documents served with a text/html â€” not in documents served with an XML MIME type.

 * x-ua-compatible
 * 
 * If specified, the content attribute must have the value "IE=edge". User agents are required to ignore this pragma.

 * refresh This instruction specifies:
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * The number of seconds until the page should be reloaded - only if the content attribute contains a non-negative integer.
 * 
 * The number of seconds until the page should redirect to another - only if the content attribute contains a non-negative integer followed by the string ';url=', and a valid URL.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Warning:
 * 
 * Pages set with a refresh value run the risk of having the time interval being too short. People navigating with the aid of assistive technology such as a screen reader may be unable to read through and understand the page's content before being automatically redirected. The abrupt, unannounced updating of the page content may also be disorienting for people experiencing low vision conditions.

 * 
 * allow-downloads-without-user-activation
 * 
 * Experimental
 * 
 * : Allows for downloads to occur without a gesture from the user.
 * 
 * allow-forms: Allows the page to submit forms. If this keyword is not used, form will be displayed as normal, but submitting it will not trigger input validation, sending data to a web server or closing a dialog.
 * 
 * allow-modals: Allows the page to open modal windows by Window.alert(), Window.confirm(), Window.print() and Window.prompt(), while opening a <dialog> is allowed regardless of this keyword. It also allows the page to receive BeforeUnloadEvent event.
 * 
 * allow-orientation-lock: Lets the resource lock the screen orientation.
 * 
 * allow-pointer-lock: Allows the page to use the Pointer Lock API.
 * 
 * allow-popups: Allows popups (like from Window.open(), target="_blank", Window.showModalDialog()). If this keyword is not used, that functionality will silently fail.
 * 
 * allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox: Allows a sandboxed document to open new windows without forcing the sandboxing flags upon them. This will allow, for example, a third-party advertisement to be safely sandboxed without forcing the same restrictions upon the page the ad links to.
 * 
 * allow-presentation: Allows embedders to have control over whether an iframe can start a presentation session.
 * 
 * allow-same-origin: If this token is not used, the resource is treated as being from a special origin that always fails the same-origin policy (potentially preventing access to data storage/cookies and some JavaScript APIs).
 * 
 * allow-scripts: Allows the page to run scripts (but not create pop-up windows). If this keyword is not used, this operation is not allowed.
 * 
 * allow-storage-access-by-user-activation
 * 
 * Experimental
 * 
 * : Allows a document loaded in the <iframe> to use the Storage Access API to request access to unpartitioned cookies.
 * 
 * allow-top-navigation: Lets the resource navigate the top-level browsing context (the one named _top).
 * 
 * allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation: Lets the resource navigate the top-level browsing context, but only if initiated by a user gesture.
 * 
 * allow-top-navigation-to-custom-protocols: Allows navigations to non-http protocols built into browser or registered by a website. This feature is also activated by allow-popups or allow-top-navigation keyword.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Note:
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * When the embedded document has the same origin as the embedding page, it is strongly discouraged to use both allow-scripts and allow-same-origin, as that lets the embedded document remove the sandbox attribute â€” making it no more secure than not using the sandbox attribute at all.
 * 
 * Sandboxing is useless if the attacker can display content outside a sandboxed iframe â€” such as if the viewer opens the frame in a new tab. Such content should be also served from a separate origin to limit potential damage. */
